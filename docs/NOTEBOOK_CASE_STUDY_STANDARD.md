# Notebook case-study standard

Project notebooks are executable technical articles backed by the project
package. They should combine the accessibility of a strong public data-science
article with the evidence and restraint expected in a professional analysis.

## Required narrative arc

Every substantial notebook should let a reader answer these questions in order:

1. **What is the question?** Name the user, decision or scientific question,
   observation unit, target or structure of interest, and why the result matters.
2. **Where did the data come from?** Link the source, state the license and
   retrieval date, and load it through `dsm_project.data` rather than an
   unexplained notebook path.
3. **Can the data support the question?** Audit shape, types, units, missingness,
   duplicates, dependence, sampling, class balance, and information available
   at use time.
4. **What does the data look like?** Use purposeful tables and plots. Each visual
   needs a question, labeled axes and units, a caption or interpretation, and an
   explanation of what it does not establish.
5. **What is the method?** Define notation, objective, assumptions, fitted
   quantities, prediction rule, hyperparameters, and failure modes before the
   code call.
6. **Where is the implementation?** Import reusable student code from
   `dsm_project`. Do not define the production estimator, data adapter, metric,
   or serving logic only in a notebook.
7. **How was it evaluated?** State split or resampling boundaries, baselines,
   metrics, uncertainty, slices, and whether the evidence is development,
   validation, or final-test evidence.
8. **What failed?** Inspect residuals, confusion patterns, unstable clusters,
   outliers, subgroups or conditions, computational limits, and plausible data
   or concept drift.
9. **What follows?** Give a bounded conclusion, limitations, responsible-use
   statement, next experiment, and production consequence.

## Code boundary

Good notebook code orchestrates and communicates:

```python
from dsm_project.config import load_config
from dsm_project.data import load_project_dataset
from dsm_project.experiments import evaluate_supervised_estimator
```

Package code performs reusable work. Notebook code may create a diagnostic plot
or a one-time explanatory calculation, but if another notebook, a test, the CLI,
or the API needs the behavior, move it under `src/dsm_project/` and test it.

## Visual and statistical standard

- Display a compact preview; never dump an entire dataset.
- Explain why each statistic or plot is relevant to the question.
- Show distributions before relying on averages.
- Label units and categories and use readable legends and color choices.
- Separate exploratory claims from confirmatory or final-test claims.
- Prefer effect sizes, uncertainty and error structure to a single score.
- Compare with a simple baseline and a trusted implementation.
- Preserve failed candidates and surprising results when they teach something.
- Do not interpret correlation, clusters, feature importance, or a projection as
  causation.

## Reproducibility standard

A reviewer must be able to restart the kernel and run all cells from top to
bottom using the named project environment. The notebook must not depend on
hidden state, a private absolute path, a manual download that is undocumented,
or a live secret embedded in a cell. Clear outputs before a pull request unless
the course submission policy explicitly asks for rendered outputs.

## Review questions

Reviewers should ask:

- Does the narrative match the package behavior?
- Are notation, units, labels, and data boundaries defined before use?
- Could any transformation see validation or test information too early?
- Are reference-library and student-authored results visibly distinguished?
- Do the diagnostics test the model's likely failure modes?
- Would a new teammate know what to reproduce, challenge, or build next?
